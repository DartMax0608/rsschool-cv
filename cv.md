# Max Pototskiy

Worked for his life in different areas of trade in different positions. For the last four and a half years I have been working as a sales representative for British American Tobacco. At the moment I want to change my occupation and become a front-end developer.

## My skils :
1. Responsibility
2. Communication
3. Analysis of business indicators 
4. Negotiation 
5. Teamwork
