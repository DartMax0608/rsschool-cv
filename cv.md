# Max Pototskiy

Worked for his life in different areas of trade in different positions. For the last four and a half years I have been working as a sales representative for British American Tobacco. At the moment I want to change my occupation and become a front-end developer.

## My skils :
1. Responsibility
2. Communication
3. Analysis of business indicators 
4. Negotiation 
5. Teamwork

## Example code:
*this task was to write a program so that it reads whether the number is ***prime*** or ***composite***
*

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Credit04 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Введите любое число");
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int i = 1;
        if (a / i == a && a % i == 0) {
            if (a % 2 == 0 || a % 3 == 0 || a % 5 == 0) {
                System.out.println("число Cоставное");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Простое число");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
